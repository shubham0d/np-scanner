=== Np-scanner TODOs ===

->use threading for multiple ip scanning

->to not get messy result in multithreading use thread lock semaphore.

->make it intellingent by skiping the dead systems and fast scan can be implement by only scanning port with expect to
have some service running on

->add full scanner which scan till 6000 ports
